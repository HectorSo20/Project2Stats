# Project2Stats

For my graduate course, Statistical Inference in Psychology I (Fall 2021) we used R to run t-tests on publicly available data. The purpose of this 
project was to see whether there were significant differences in SAT average scores (by subject) and the number of SAT exams taken for Massachusetts 
high schools across two academic years 2018-19 (Pre COVID-19 year) and 2019-20 (COVID-19 year).
The data for this study can be found here: https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/statereport/sat.aspx 

The results of my project showed that there were significantly less SAT exams taken during the 2019-20 school year compared to the 2018-19 academic year. 
In addition, there were higher SAT averages for both Reading/Writing and Math sections across high schools during the 2019-20 academic year.
